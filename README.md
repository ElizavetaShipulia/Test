Example of RGBW LED Control via I2C

This project demonstrates working with an RGBW LED driver chip over I2C. The code is written in C and uses the i2c_rgbw.h module.

Description

In the repository you will find:

- main.c — main program file
- i2c_rgbw.h / i2c_rgbw.c — interface and implementation for I2C control (should be implemented for your platform)

Features

- Initialization of RGBW LEDs via I2C
- Turning all channels on or off simultaneously
- Adjusting brightness and state for each channel individually
- Setting brightness for all channels at once

Dependencies

- Implementation of i2c_rgbw.h and i2c_rgbw.c for your platform
- C compiler

Usage

1. Clone the repository  
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/PROJECT_NAME.git  
2. Add or implement the i2c_rgbw.c and i2c_rgbw.h modules for your microcontroller  
3. Build and upload the project to your device
